# Pytree

Chill, chat, and grow a tree!

This bot is a general multi-purpose bot for our private server of friends. You can chat to level up, and grow a tree every month. You can also earn coins and catch the bugs around your tree, and rank up in the leaderboards.

To start using the bot, type `/` in the chat! To learn more about using the bot, check out [the wiki](https://github.com/writeblankspace/pytree/wiki).
